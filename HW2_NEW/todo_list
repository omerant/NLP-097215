1. create DepParsingDataReader class according to the format of the input file
2. create DepParsingDataset class
	1. pass word_embeddings in init (nn.Embedding)
	2. pass tag embeddings in init (nn.Embedding)
	
3. create DnnDepParser class
	1. init word embeddings
	2. init tag embeddings
	3. create mapping between dependency and number
	4. forward ((word_idx_tensor, tag_idx_tensor)) with following steps
		1. get words' embeddings
		2. get tags' embeddings
		3. concat word+tag embeddings
		4. path embeddings through lstm, the output dim is n^2 (all possible dependencies)
		5. path lstm output to MLP (input and output dim are n^2)
		
	improvements:
	1. split MLP multiplication to two separate multiplications
	2. store multiplication results across different pairs
	3. stack several bidirectional LSTMS
	4. word dropout
